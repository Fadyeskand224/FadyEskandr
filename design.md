## Design Philosophy

**Color Palette**: Modern tech-forward palette with deep navy (#1a1d29), soft cream (#f8f6f0), and warm copper accents (#c17a5b). This creates a sophisticated, professional aesthetic that stands out from typical tech portfolios.

**Typography**: Bold serif display font (Playfair Display) for headings paired with clean sans-serif (Inter) for body text. This combination creates editorial sophistication while maintaining technical readability.

**Visual Language**: Clean, grid-aligned layouts with strategic use of negative space. Emphasis on content hierarchy and visual flow that guides users through your story and technical expertise.
